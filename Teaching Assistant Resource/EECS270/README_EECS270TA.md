# EECS 270 – TA Teaching Resources

This folder contains selected teaching materials that Wenyue Li created while serving as a **Teaching Assistant for EECS 270: Introduction to Logic Design** at Shanghai Jiaotong University.

EECS 270 is a 4-credit course covering boolean algebra, digital design techniques, logic gates, combinational and sequential circuits, finite state machines, arithmetic circuits, and CAD-based design implemented on an FPGA.

## Contents

The materials in this folder focus on supporting students’ understanding of core digital logic concepts and lab work. They may include:

- **Review slides and handouts** for midterm and final exam preparation  
- **Problem sets and worksheet-style exercises** that reinforce topics such as FSM design, timing, and Verilog/HDL modeling  
- **Example circuit designs or code snippets** used in discussion or office hours  
- **Concept summaries / cheat sheets** that highlight common pitfalls and design patterns

All materials are authored or substantially revised by Wenyue Li and were used to guide students during discussions, office hours, and review sessions.

## Notes on Scope and Copyright

To respect course policies and copyright:

- Official exam papers, solution keys, and instructor-provided proprietary materials are **not** included here.
- The resources are intended to illustrate Wenyue Li’s teaching style and ability to explain technical content, rather than to reproduce the full EECS 270 course content.

These artifacts demonstrate Wenyue Li’s experience in teaching assistance, mentoring, and clarifying foundational digital logic and FPGA design concepts.
