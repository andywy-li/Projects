# EECS 280 – Programming and Introductory Data Structures

This folder contains selected projects from **EECS 280: Programming and Introductory Data Structures** at the University of Michigan.

EECS 280 is a 4-credit core course on algorithm development and effective programming in C++. It covers top-down design, structured programming, unit testing, and program correctness, as well as key language concepts such as scope, static and runtime semantics, recursion, and parameter passing. The data-structure topics include arrays, records, pointers, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and other abstract data types.

The projects included here showcase Wenyue Li’s work on:
- Implementing and testing non-trivial C++ programs from scratch.
- Designing and using fundamental data structures to solve practical problems.
- Writing clean, well-documented, and modular code with automated tests.

Only the more representative assignments are included; they are intended to demonstrate Wenyue Li’s programming fundamentals and comfort with data-structure-oriented problem solving.
