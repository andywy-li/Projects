# Literature Review on AI Applications in Aerospace Engineering

This folder documents Wenyue Li’s independent research project on the **applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in aerospace engineering**.

## Project Overview

This work began as an extended literature review during an online seminar on machine learning and AI.  
The goal was to systematically survey how AI methods are being applied across different aerospace domains and to synthesize a clear technical picture of current capabilities, challenges, and future directions.

In this project, Wenyue Li:

- Collected and screened a large number of peer-reviewed papers on AI in aerospace (flight control, guidance and navigation, fault diagnosis, structural health monitoring, trajectory optimization, etc.).
- Organized the literature by **application domain**, **AI technique** (e.g., neural networks, reinforcement learning, optimization-based methods), and **system level** (component, subsystem, full vehicle).
- Analyzed the advantages and limitations of AI-based approaches compared with traditional model-based methods.
- Discussed open challenges such as safety, interpretability, robustness, and certification in safety-critical aerospace systems.
- Consolidated the findings into a structured review paper, with figures and tables summarizing trends and research gaps.

This project demonstrates Wenyue Li’s ability to read and synthesize a broad technical literature, structure complex information, and communicate it in a clear, publication-style format.

## Publication and Availability

The review has been developed into a **formal review paper** on the application of AI in aerospace engineering.
